# LinuxLowMemoryNotifier
a tiny php script to send system notification whenever your machine's memory is running out


1. add the script to your linux startup scripts (init.d).
2. Change conf.txt file to your preferences.
for example:
"3,30" means that the script will check every 30 seconds if there are at least 3GB of available memory.

Have fun!
